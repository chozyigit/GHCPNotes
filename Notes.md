## Q&A Strategy

Use a question-and-answer format to engage the user. This way GHCP can remind you important details and help you to find the right solution.

- **Tip 1:** Prompt GHCP to prepare Yes/No questions for the user after the main prompt. That will help to provide more meaningful content for the task.
- **Tip 2:** Limit the number of the questions to 3-5. This will help to keep the user engaged and not overwhelmed.

**Example Prompt** "Ask me 5 yes/no questions that will help you provide a better recomendation for my task."

## Pros and Cons Strategy

Use a pros and cons approach to get different solutions with their advantages and disadvantages. Forcing GHCP to think about the pros and cons of each option will help to get a more comprehensive answer.

- **Tip 1:** Ask GHCP to provide a list of pros and cons for each option.
- **Tip 2:** Limit the number of options to 3-5 to prevent overwhelming number of suggestions.
